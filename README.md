# candles
In this repository I've created charts to illustrate candle data. There are examples of conditional formatting and a pivot chart. 
You will be able to see the different scents of candles available and easily see their catagories according to season and which scent vendor the scent was purchased from. You will also see the prices of the scents illustrated in a bar chart.
